Image classification problem using deep convolutional neural networks. The dataset consists of images obtained from concrete bridge decks, pavements, and walls. The images can contain either cracks or no cracks. Our objective in this challenge is to develop a binary image classification model that can classify from a given image if it contains any cracks or not.
